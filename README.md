## 🚚 Delivery Time Prediction - Machine Learning Project  

This project aims to predict delivery time based on various factors such as distance, weather conditions, traffic levels, time of day, and vehicle type. Using machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate delivery time estimates to enhance logistics and customer satisfaction.  

### 📂 Project Overview  
- **Objective:**  
  To develop a predictive model for estimating delivery time based on key influencing factors.  

- **Technologies Used:**  
  - Python  
  - Flask (for web interface)  
  - Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)  
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)  
  - Joblib (for model deployment)  
  - HTML, CSS (for frontend UI)  

- **Key Features:**  
  - User-friendly web interface for inputting delivery parameters  
  - Machine learning model to estimate delivery time  
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques  
  - Model deployment using Flask  
  - Error handling for incorrect user inputs  

### 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of delivery records containing attributes such as:  
- `Distance (km)`  
- `Preparation Time (min)`  
- `Weather Condition`  
- `Traffic Level`  
- `Time of Day`  
- `Vehicle Type`  
- `Delivery Time (Target Variable)`  

### 🚀 How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delivery-time-prediction.git
   cd delivery-time-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

### 📈 Model Performance  
The model was trained and evaluated using regression metrics, and achieved the following results:  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** _X.XX_  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** _X.XX_  
- **R² Score:** _X.XX_
